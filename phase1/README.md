<h1>
Yak-Again </h1>

<h1> Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection </h1>

A couple of years ago, there was an app called Yik-Yak. It consisted of an (optionally) anonymous message board that was only accessible in a certain radius. Users had their own accounts, included with messaging and friend systems. It was namely aimed at college students, but anybody could create an account.

This resulted in some problems. The biggest one being that the younger high school students (who could just lie about their age) had full access to all of the posts that were college students that could be in the same radius (especially in places like Chico, where Chico High School and CSU Chico are right next to each other). Because users could upload pictures, the high school students could see things that they aren’t supposed to. Even worse, is that sometimes people advertised their parties on Yik-Yak, which could lead to high-schoolers attempting to access them and engage in under-age drinking. 

Although the app shut down because the company got bought out, there probably would have been some lawsuits that would have come out of all of this. So my group thought of a solution to this problem, where it’s the exact same as Yik-Yak only with an added security layer: college credential verification. Although this would limit our user-base quite a bit, this would solve the problem of under-age users being able to get on it. Before someone would create an app like this, they would need to collect data on their users to find out if they would be comfortable with an approach like this. 

We were prepared to collect data on our users with a survey that was going to be sent out to our fellow college students via Linkedin and Discord, however COVID-19 put a wrench in our plans. We instead collected a small amount of mock-data from our classmates. While they are our target demographic, we would need a much larger amount of responses in a scenario like this. However, we are still going to draw conclusions and such from what we have. 

<h1> Methods: </h1>

For the methods, we only used a survey. This would cover our needs, because all we really need to ask is if they would be comfortable with an app validating them using their college credentials, and if they would trust an app when it says that it does not tie your college credentials to your posts. 

<h1> Findings: </h1>

Our findings went against our expectations. When we were going to go out into discord and LinkedIn to get college students to answer our survey, we had the concern that not that many of them would say that they have used Yik-Yak when it was out because It has been off the app store for a couple years now. However, 55% of our responses say that they have. This is mock data, but they are all still college students non the less. Not only that, but 77% of our responses said that they would be comfortable giving their college credentials to verify their age with this app. Even when the vast majority of our responses are only a 3 on the 1-5 scale that rate how comfortable that they would be doing so, this was well beyond our expectations. What was not surprising to us, was that 77% of people said that they wouldn’t believe an app when it says that It does not tie their credentials to their anonymous posts. With all of the data privacy scandals going on with many social media platforms in the past few years, we understand this number. A good follow up question that we thought of when examining these results is that would they feel comfortable if the app explicitly stated that it doesn’t do this in its terms and conditions.

<h1> Conclusions: </h1>

With this data, we feel as though our solution to our problem is a viable one. We feel that most college students would trust an app similar to Yik-Yak, but with college credential verification. As for not trusting an app when it says that it does not tie your anonymous posts to your credentials, we feel as if they would still feel comfortable with the degree of anonymity that is provided. 

<h1> Caveats: </h1>

We are unable to ask follow up questions for our fellow students, as the deadline for them giving mock data has passed. It would be very interesting to know why the majority of our responders would not trust an app when it says that it does not tie your credentials to your posts. 

<h1> Personas: </h1>

Jeff: 18-yr old, just left for college to get his digital media degree. Although he is a very outgoing and social person, he does not know anybody in the area, not even the other people in his dorms yet. He has both Snapchat and Instagram accounts.

Marissa: 21-yr old, Junior in college. Very quiet and reserved, and an introvert. Has a very small group of friends, and does not like parties. Listens to electronic music, and has a pet cat named Lucas. 

<h1> Scenarios: </h1>

-Scenario 1: Jeff is trying to meet fellow students that enjoy rock climbing and needs a place to go to find people that go to his college that share a similar interest. Jeff is worried that some people might be older non-college people and doesn’t know how to check.
-Scenario 2: Marissa has to go home for a Doctor’s appointment this weekend and can no longer attend her concert downtown. She wants to find a local, trustworthy college student to sell her ticket to, and needs a place where she can ensure that this happens.
