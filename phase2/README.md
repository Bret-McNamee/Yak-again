## Phase 2: Interaction Design


**-learnability:** The ability for the user of the technology to figure out how it works from the moment that they first use it. The users will know how to use a product with good learnability minutes after picking it up. 

**-usefulness:** How much the product is able to be used. This one is a bit tricky because it is highly subjective as people will have different needs (a baker isnâ€™t going to use software on designing buildings).

**-error tolerant:** The consequences of the technology not working when it is supposed to. A space station must have next to no error tolerance, while a bookshelf breaking has pretty high error tolerance.
